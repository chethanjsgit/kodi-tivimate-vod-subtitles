# Kodi Handoff Edition — Auto Subtitles & Resume for TiviMate / IPTV VOD

**Automatic subtitles and resume playback for TiviMate and any IPTV / VOD app on
Kodi — Fire TV Stick, Android TV, and Google TV.** Play a movie or TV show from
your IPTV app and it opens in Kodi with the **correct title**, **subtitles
downloaded automatically and remembered**, and **resume from where you left
off**. Everything is in one sideloaded APK — no add-ons to install.

Subtitles are found automatically across several sources, in order:
**OpenSubtitles.com** first, then **OpenSubtitles.org** (great for brand-new
shows the .com site doesn't have yet), then **SubtitleCat** — no login needed for
the fallbacks. Especially handy for **TiviMate VOD** and shows with long, messy
IPTV release filenames.

*Keywords: TiviMate subtitles, Kodi IPTV subtitles, Fire TV Stick subtitles,
Android TV / Google TV, VOD movies & TV shows, OpenSubtitles, SubtitleCat, auto
subtitle downloader, resume playback, external player for IPTV.*

Works on **Fire TV Stick** and most **Android TV / Google TV** devices.

## Before you start — create a free OpenSubtitles.com account

Subtitles are downloaded from OpenSubtitles.com, and you need a (free) account
for it to work. Do this first, on your phone or computer:

1. Go to **https://www.opensubtitles.com** and click **Register / Sign up**.
2. Pick a **username** and **password**, and confirm your email.
3. Remember that username and password — you'll type them into Kodi in Step 5.

**Important:** OpenSubtitles.com and the older OpenSubtitles.**org** are two
different websites with separate accounts. Make sure you register at
OpenSubtitles.**com** — a .org account will not work here.

## Install — just follow these steps in order

You'll do this once. Take about 5 minutes.

### Step 1 — Get the "Downloader" app

- **Fire TV Stick:** from the Fire TV home screen, search (magnifying glass) for
  **Downloader**, and install the orange app by AFTVnews.
- **Android TV / Google TV:** open the **Google Play Store**, search for
  **Downloader**, and install it.

### Step 2 — Turn on app installing (do this once)

**On Fire TV Stick:**
1. Go to **Settings** (the gear icon) → **My Fire TV** → **Developer options**.
   - Don't see Developer options? Go to **Settings → My Fire TV → About**, then
     click on the **device name** 7 times until it says you're a developer, then
     go back.
2. Turn on **Install unknown apps** (or "Apps from Unknown Sources"), and in the
   list, turn it **ON for Downloader**.

**On Android TV / Google TV:**
1. Go to **Settings → System → About**, scroll to **Android TV OS build**, and
   click it **7 times** until it says "You are now a developer."
2. Go to **Settings → Apps → Security & restrictions → Unknown sources**, and
   turn it **ON for Downloader**.

### Step 3 — Remove any old Kodi first (important)

If you already have Kodi installed, **uninstall it** before continuing, or the
new app won't install. (Settings → Applications → find Kodi → Uninstall.)
If you've never had Kodi, skip this step.

### Step 4 — Download and install with the code

1. Open the **Downloader** app.
2. In the box at the top, type this code: **`4186239`** and press **Go**.
3. Wait for it to download (it's about 65 MB).
4. When it finishes, a screen asks **"Do you want to install this
   application?"** — choose **Install**.
5. After it installs, choose **Done** (not "Open" yet — Downloader will offer to
   delete the downloaded file; you can say **Delete** to save space).

### Step 5 — Open Kodi and sign in to subtitles (once)

1. Open **Kodi** (it may say "Preparing for first run" — wait a moment).
2. It will ask for your **OpenSubtitles.com username**, then **password** —
   type in the ones you created in the "Before you start" step above.
   - Want to do it later? Press **Back** on each prompt; you can add it anytime
     (see "If something's not working" below).
3. That's the only setup. It won't ask again.

### Step 6 — Tell your IPTV app to use Kodi

In **TiviMate**: Settings → **Playback** → **Video player** → **Custom player**
→ choose **Kodi**.
(Other IPTV apps: wherever you pick an "external" or "custom" player, choose
**Kodi**.)

**Done!** Now play anything in your IPTV app and it opens in Kodi with the title,
subtitles, and resume all handled for you.

## How to use it day to day

- **Just play** a movie or episode in your IPTV app — it opens in Kodi.
- **Subtitles usually come on by themselves** — the best-rated match is
  downloaded and shown automatically.
- **If subtitles don't show up**, download them by hand — it's quick:
  1. During playback, press the **Select/OK** button to bring up the on-screen
     controls.
  2. Click the **Subtitles icon** (the speech bubble, right next to the **gear**
     icon at the bottom).
  3. Choose **Download subtitle** and pick one from the list (names with
     "WEB-DL" or "WEBRip" usually match IPTV streams best).
  The one you pick shows right away — and is remembered for next time.
- A subtitle you've used for a title is **remembered** — next time it comes back
  automatically, no downloading again.
- **Resume:** stop or leave anytime. Play the same title again and it jumps back
  to where you stopped ("Resumed at …" flashes on screen).
- **Subtitles a little early or late?** During playback: **Select/OK** →
  speech-bubble icon → **Subtitle delay**, and nudge it. Choose "Set as default
  for all media" to keep it.

## If something's not working

- **"Failed to download subtitle (HTTP 406)"** — your free OpenSubtitles.com
  account has used its 20 downloads for the day. It resets every day. Subtitles
  you already have still work and don't count again.
- **Subtitles didn't appear on their own** — no problem, grab them manually:
  press **Select/OK** during playback, click the **Subtitles icon** (speech
  bubble, next to the gear icon), then **Download subtitle**.
- **"No subtitles found"** on a brand-new movie — subtitles may not exist yet
  that early on either OpenSubtitles or SubtitleCat. Make sure your
  OpenSubtitles.com login is entered (Step 5) so all results show.
- **A subtitle looks machine-translated** — for less common languages,
  SubtitleCat sometimes only has AI-translated subtitles. The app prefers
  human/original ones and only uses AI as a last resort.
- **The title/subtitles/resume don't happen** — your IPTV app is opening Kodi
  the wrong way. Recheck Step 6: it must use **Kodi** as the custom/external
  player.
- **Need to change your OpenSubtitles login later** — in Kodi: Settings →
  Add-ons → My add-ons → Subtitle download services → OpenSubtitles.com →
  Configure.

## Getting a newer version later

New versions are posted here: **https://github.com/chethanjsgit/kodi-tivimate-vod-subtitles/releases**
Install a newer one the same way (Downloader code above) — it installs right
over the old one and keeps your settings and history.

If it spared you the usual streaming rituals — hunting for a subtitle that
actually syncs, or scrubbing back through half an episode because the player
forgot where you were — and you feel like sending a few bucks its way:

Donate the price of a coffee, a taco, or nothing at all — genuinely no
